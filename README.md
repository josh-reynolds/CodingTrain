Projects from Daniel Shiffman's Coding Train YouTube channel.

A bit of housecleaning first. I worked through ~20 of these a few months back, but never pushed to GitHub. Correcting that, then will keep plugging away at the channel on a slower pace.

I'm doing all exercises in classic Java Processing. On the channel Shiffman changes between that and JavaScript frequently. Translations and substitutions are needed in a few cases.

Also, as fits the nature of the channel (live programming in a short video format), these are all very quick and dirty. Lots of improvements could be made in performance, error handling, structure and so on. In some cases I have comments in the scripts listing out future features if the project is extended.

His books (esp. The Nature of Code) are fun too - will be working through those sometime.

The topics he covers overlap with a bunch of explorations I'm pursuing from other resources, like:

> 10 PRINT
> Fractals
> Maze Generation
> Raycasting
> Cellular Automata

It's educational to solve these problems multiple ways, in different languages.
